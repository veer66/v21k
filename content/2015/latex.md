Title: My note about (Xe) LaTeX on Fedora 22
Date: 2015/11/1
*/

I installed these packages every time I install Fedora (GNU/Linux). And every time, I always forget what to install. So I decided to take these note.

The packages that I need are as follow:

* texlive-algorithmicx
* texlive-linguex
* texlive-fontspec (as far as I remember, it has been installed by default.)
* texlive-txfonts
* texlive-booktabs
* texlive-colortbl
* texlive-polyglossia
* texlive-fonts-tlwg
* texlive-txfonts
* texlive-euenc
